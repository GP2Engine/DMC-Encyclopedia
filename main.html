              <p style="color:white">In this website you will find our effort to create a constantly developing encyclopedia of most Exotic and Sports diecast models in 1/18 as well as the huge 1/12 scale. So far our encyclopedia is in its first stages which means that only a small number of model cars is already listed. However, we will keep updating it and adding as many as we can and as many as we can afford. Stay tuned. We hope you will enjoy it as much as we do.</p>

              <p style="color:white">A model vehicle or toy vehicle is a miniature representation of an automobile. Other miniature motor vehicles, such as trucks, buses, or even ATVs, etc. are often included in the general category of model cars. Because many miniature vehicles were originally aimed at children as playthings, there is no precise difference between a model car and a toy car, yet the word 'model' implies either assembly required or some attempt at accurate rendering of an actual vehicle at smaller scale. Regarding the former, the kit building hobby became popular through the 1950s, while the collecting of miniatures by adults started to pick up steam around 1970. Precision detailed miniatures made specifically for adults are a significant part of the market since perhaps the mid-1980s</p>

              <h2 style="color:black"><b><u>The history of Model Cars</u></b></h2><br>
              <p style="color:white">Miniature models of automobiles first appeared just about the time real automobiles did - first in Europe and then, shortly after, in the United States (Harvey 1974, p. 1995-1996). These were duplicates often made of lead and brass (Harvey 1974, p. 1995). Later models made in the early decades of the twentieth century were toys of slush cast plaster or iron. Tin and pressed steel cars, trucks, and military vehicles, like those made by Bing of Germany followed in the 1920s through the 1940s, but period models rarely copied actual vehicles - it is unclear why, but likely had to do with the crudeness of early casting and metal shaping techniques which prevented precision rendering of an actual car's shape and detail in miniature (Harvey 1974, p. 1995, 1997). Casting vehicles in various alloys, usually zinc (called zamac or mazac), also started during these decades and came on stronger in the late 1930s and prominent particularly after World War II.Post war, pressed tin and diecast zinc alloy became the main material used in Europe and Japan for miniature vehicles (Earle 2009). Mass-produced diecast metal toys appeared in America as well, but unlike those in Europe, they were often very simple, meanwhile plastics surged and became popular, even by the mid-1950s. Rather late, tin and pressed steel came to Japan during the 1950s and 1960s, and that country quickly moved into diecast by the 1970s. Today, China, and other countries of Southeast Asia are the main producers of diecast metal miniature vehicles from European, American, and Japanese companies. For the most part only specialty models for collectors are still made in the Europe or the United States.</p>
